          <h2>Forgotten Streets: The Voices of Lost Childhood</h2>
          <p><strong>Content Type:</strong> Documentary film</p>

            <h3>Logline</h3>
          <p>
            A heartfelt documentary that reveals the everyday battles, dreams, and resilience of children living on the streets, fighting to survive in a world that often refuses to see them.
          </p>

            <h3>Promotional Spiel</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Forgotten Streets: The Voices of Lost Childhood</strong> brings viewers face-to-face with the unseen reality of street-dwelling children — kids who deserve safety, education, and love, yet grow up surrounded by struggle instead of support. This documentary aims to spark awareness and empathy by highlighting their daily challenges: searching for food, protection, and a place to belong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through raw storytelling and real-life accounts, the film explores the reasons they end up in the streets — poverty, broken families, neglect — while uncovering their quiet hope for a brighter tomorrow. As a creator, we want our stream to be a platform that not only informs but inspires discussion and compassion. We expect to face emotional and technical challenges during production, but we are committed to presenting their truth with respect and integrity. Our goal is to connect with audiences who care about social issues and encourage them to engage, learn, and take part in creating change.
